# Chapter 12: Surrounding Yourself with Positive Influences

As a footballer, your environment plays a crucial role in shaping your mindset and your level of motivation. Being surrounded by negative influences can quickly demotivate even the most passionate footballers.

To counteract negativity, it's important to surround yourself with positive influences. You need to create an environment that fosters your development, both as a footballer and as a person.

In this chapter, we'll explore some effective strategies for building a positive support system and creating an environment that fuels your motivation. We'll discuss the importance of identifying and avoiding negative influences, and we'll provide actionable advice for cultivating a network of supportive and encouraging people.

Remember, surrounding yourself with positivity isn't just about feeling good – it's about creating an environment that helps you achieve your goals and reach your full potential as a footballer. It's time to take control of your environment and start surrounding yourself with people and influences that inspire you to greatness!
# Chapter 12: Surrounding Yourself with Positive Influences CODE

## 1. Identify Negative Influences
The first step to creating a positive environment is to identify and eliminate negative influences. These can be people, situations, or even your own negative thoughts and self-talk. Use the following code to identify negative influences in your environment:

```python
negative_people = ["Gossiping teammates", "Negative-minded coach"]
negative_situations = ["Tense locker room", "Toxic online communities"]
negative_thoughts = ["Self-doubt", "Fear of failure"]

def eliminate_negative_influences():
  for person in negative_people:
    if person in current_environment:
      current_environment.remove(person)
      
  for situation in negative_situations:
    if situation in current_environment:
      current_environment.remove(situation)
      
  for thought in negative_thoughts:
    if thought in current_mindset:
      current_mindset.remove(thought)
```

## 2. Cultivate Positive Relationships
Once you've eliminated negative influences, it's time to focus on building positive relationships. Seek out people who inspire and motivate you to be your best. Use the following code to start cultivating positive relationships:

```python
positive_people = ["Encouraging teammates", "Supportive coach"]
positive_friends = ["Mentors who have succeeded in football career"]
positive_thoughts = ["Positive self-talk", "Visualize success"]

def build_positive_relationships():
  for person in positive_people:
    if person not in current_environment:
      current_environment.append(person)
      
  for friend in positive_friends:
    if friend not in current_friends:
      current_friends.append(friend)
      
  for thought in positive_thoughts:
    if thought not in current_mindset:
      current_mindset.append(thought)
```

## 3. Create a Supportive Community
Building a community of supportive people is a great way to stay motivated and inspired, both on and off the field. Use the following code to create a supportive community:

```python
supportive_community = {
  "Fitness enthusiasts who meet regularly at park": 5,
  "Facebook group that discusses different team strategies": 100,
  "Instagram page of footballers with a positive mindset": 10k
}

def join_a_supportive_community():
  for community in supportive_community:
    if supportive_community[community] > minimum_members:
      join_community(community)
```

By utilizing these three steps, you can create an environment that is conducive to your success as a footballer and as a person. Surrounding yourself with positive influences can help you stay motivated, focused, and committed to achieving your goals.
In Chapter 12, we provided three steps for developing a positive environment as a footballer – identify negative influences, cultivate positive relationships, and create a supportive community. Our accompanying Python code demonstrated how to implement these steps.

The code used in the first step, `eliminate_negative_influences()`, takes three lists as inputs – `negative_people`, `negative_situations`, and `negative_thoughts`. This function identifies each negative influence in the current environment and removes them.

The second step, `build_positive_relationships()`, takes three lists as inputs – `positive_people`, `positive_friends`, and `positive_thoughts`. This function identifies each positive influence that isn't already present in the current environment, current group of friends, or current mindset. It then adds them to the appropriate category so that the positive influences can be cultivated.

The third step, `join_a_supportive_community()`, takes a dictionary as input – `supportive_community`. This function checks the `minimum_members` variable (which is not shown in the code) and adds each supportive community that has more members than that value.

By implementing all three steps, footballers can identify and remove negative influences from their environment while also building a positive social network. Additionally, joining supportive communities can help provide motivation and accountability to stay focused on achieving their goals.
